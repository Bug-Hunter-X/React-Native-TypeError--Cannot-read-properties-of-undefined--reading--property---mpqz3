This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data might not have loaded yet.  For example, imagine you're trying to render a user's name from fetched data:

```javascript
const UserComponent = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text>  // Error if user is null or undefined
    </View>
  );
};
```

If `user` is null or undefined before the data fetches successfully, this will throw a TypeError.  Another place where this commonly occurs is in deeply nested objects where a property along the way may be missing.
