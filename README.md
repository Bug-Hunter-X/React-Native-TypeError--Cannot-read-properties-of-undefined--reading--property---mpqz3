# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`. This error arises when trying to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a simulator or physical device.
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves using optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators to safely access properties.

## Additional Notes

This error is common in React Native and understanding how to handle asynchronous data properly is crucial for building robust applications.
